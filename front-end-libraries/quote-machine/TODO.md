* Use nix
* Add sentiment analysis to check if quote is happy or not and change background accordingly
* Add quotes to favorites
* Find a way to get the quote box to have some minimum height
* Currently the refresh time is repeated in 3 different places, find some way to DRY it. Note: It seems like it's real easy to share a variable between javascript and sass, however, I can't do it. Maybe I could define the animations using css and share it so?
* Make my own backend for it or maybe use the one from quotable but deploy it locally
* Add bootstrap popover to twitter when trying to tweet something longer than 140 characters
* Do I need "loading" for the refresh effect? Can't I just set the transition "in" to true or false or something?
* Debug: Change any value directly in the window. Wouldn't it be cool?
* Debug: Collapse fetch responses by default and allow expanding them
* Alert: Maybe add dismiss button?
* Alert: Maybe extract it to its own component
* Use redux?
