* Use nix
* Show error when requesting a new quote by the same author and there is none
* Add sentiment analysis to check if quote is happy or not and change background accordingly
* Add quotes to favorites
* Find a way to get the quote box to have some minimum height
* Currently the refresh time is repeated in 4 different places, find some way to DRY it. Note: It seems like it's real easy to share a variable between javascript and sass, however, I can't do it. Maybe I could define the animations using css and share it so?
* Make my own backend for it or maybe use the one from quotable but deploy it locally
